python -m pytest tests/ -m "unit" --cov=saidata_gen --cov-report=html

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/ -m "integration" -v

# Run performance benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/ -m "slow" --durations=10

# Run comprehensive test suite
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_interfaces_comprehensive.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v
```
