# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the current saidata provider template structure to follow a more efficient and maintainable pattern. The current provider files contain redundant information that duplicates the general defaults, making them harder to maintain and understand. The new structure should only include provider-specific overrides and differences from the general defaults, following the pattern established in the examples directory.

When generating saidata for a given software, a directory with the software name is created, and inside that directory there's a structure similar to the one in examples/saidata/example, including a defaults.yaml file and a providers subdirectory with individual provider files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining saidata provider configurations, I want provider files to only contain settings that differ from the general defaults, so that the configuration is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider file is created or updated THEN it SHALL only contain settings that are different from the general defaults
2. WHEN a setting has the same value as the general default THEN it SHALL NOT be included in the provider file
3. WHEN a provider file is processed THEN the system SHALL merge provider-specific settings with general defaults correctly
4. WHEN reviewing provider configurations THEN developers SHALL be able to quickly identify provider-specific customizations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with unsupported providers, I want a clear way to indicate when a provider doesn't support a particular package, so that the system can handle these cases appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider does not support a package THEN the provider file SHALL contain `supported: false`
2. WHEN `supported: false` is set THEN no other configuration keys SHALL be required in the provider file
3. WHEN the system processes a provider with `supported: false` THEN it SHALL skip that provider for the given package
4. WHEN generating metadata THEN unsupported providers SHALL be excluded from the output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining provider configurations, I want to avoid null or undefined values in provider files, so that the configuration is cleaner and more readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider doesn't have a known value for a configuration key THEN the key SHALL NOT be included in the provider file
2. WHEN a key is not present in a provider file THEN the system SHALL use the default value from the general defaults
3. WHEN processing provider configurations THEN null values SHALL NOT be explicitly written to provider files
4. WHEN merging configurations THEN missing keys SHALL be treated as using the default value

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the saidata generation system, I want the refactored provider structure to be backward compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new provider structure is implemented THEN existing metadata generation workflows SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN provider files are refactored THEN the output metadata SHALL remain functionally equivalent
3. WHEN the system processes both old and new provider file formats THEN it SHALL handle both correctly during a transition period
4. WHEN tests are run after refactoring THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without modification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the saidata system, I want automated tools to help with the refactoring process, so that the migration can be done efficiently and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring provider files THEN there SHALL be automated tools to identify redundant settings
2. WHEN migrating to the new structure THEN there SHALL be validation tools to ensure correctness
3. WHEN processing provider files THEN there SHALL be tools to detect and report configuration inconsistencies
4. WHEN updating provider files THEN there SHALL be automated formatting to ensure consistency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple providers, I want templates for all supported providers and comprehensive provider coverage, so that the system can generate complete saidata configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating saidata THEN there SHALL be templates available for all supported package managers and providers
2. WHEN running example scripts THEN they SHALL use all available providers by default to demonstrate comprehensive coverage
3. WHEN a new provider is added to the system THEN there SHALL be a corresponding template file created
4. WHEN processing software metadata THEN all relevant providers SHALL be considered unless explicitly excluded

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user generating saidata, I want an AI option that enhances the generated metadata with information from LLMs, so that I can get more complete and comprehensive package information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the generate command THEN there SHALL be an AI option that queries LLMs for additional package information
2. WHEN the AI option is enabled THEN the system SHALL merge data from provider repositories with LLM responses
3. WHEN merging AI and repository data THEN provider repository data SHALL be considered more authoritative and take precedence
4. WHEN LLM data is used THEN it SHALL primarily fill in missing information for URLs, ports, processes, and other metadata not available in provider repositories
5. WHEN AI enhancement is complete THEN the final saidata SHALL be a comprehensive merge of both data sources
6. WHEN the AI option is not specified THEN the system SHALL work with repository data only, maintaining backward compatibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple providers, I want clear documentation and examples of the new provider structure, so that I can create and maintain provider configurations correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN there SHALL be updated documentation explaining the provider override pattern
2. WHEN creating new provider files THEN there SHALL be clear examples showing the correct format
3. WHEN working with provider configurations THEN there SHALL be guidelines for determining what should be included in provider files
4. WHEN troubleshooting provider issues THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining the configuration merging process
