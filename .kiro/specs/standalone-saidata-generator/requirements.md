# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a standalone Python module and command-line tool for generating saidata YAML files. The tool will be distributed as a separate git repository and Python package, inspired by the existing scripts in saidata/bin and documentation in saidata/docs, while strictly following the saidata-0.1.schema.json specification. The generator will automate the creation of comprehensive software metadata files for various package managers and platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate saidata YAML files for software packages using a standalone Python tool, so that I can create accurate metadata without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the tool via pip THEN the system SHALL provide a command-line interface accessible as `saidata-gen`
2. WHEN I provide a software name THEN the system SHALL generate a complete YAML file conforming to saidata-0.1.schema.json
3. WHEN generating metadata THEN the system SHALL gather information from multiple package repositories and sources
4. IF the software exists in multiple package managers THEN the system SHALL include provider-specific package configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to fetch metadata from various package repositories, so that I can generate comprehensive software definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the metadata fetcher THEN the system SHALL support apt, dnf, brew, winget, scoop, and other major package managers
2. WHEN fetching repository data THEN the system SHALL follow the patterns established in saidata/bin/fetch_repodata.sh
3. WHEN repository data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle failures and continue with available sources
4. WHEN fetching completes THEN the system SHALL cache results to improve subsequent generation speed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want to validate generated saidata files against the official schema, so that I can ensure compatibility with the saidata ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I validate a generated file THEN the system SHALL check it against saidata-0.1.schema.json
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with field-specific details
3. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm schema compliance
4. WHEN validating multiple files THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for software packages across multiple repositories, so that I can find the correct package names and avoid duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for software THEN the system SHALL query multiple package repositories simultaneously
2. WHEN multiple matches are found THEN the system SHALL display package details and repository sources
3. WHEN I use partial names THEN the system SHALL provide fuzzy matching and suggestions
4. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to batch process multiple software packages, so that I can efficiently generate metadata for large software inventories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a list of software names THEN the system SHALL process them in batch with progress reporting
2. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL handle individual failures without stopping the entire process
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed summary of successes and failures
4. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays and retry logic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to configure data sources and providers, so that I can customize metadata generation for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure the tool THEN the system SHALL support YAML-based configuration files
2. WHEN I add custom providers THEN the system SHALL allow provider-specific templates and commands
3. WHEN I specify data sources THEN the system SHALL validate source connectivity and format
4. WHEN sources are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to verify the accuracy of generated metadata, so that I can ensure data quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata is generated THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores for different data fields
2. WHEN verification is requested THEN the system SHALL cross-reference data across multiple sources
3. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include source attribution and generation timestamps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate the generator into CI/CD pipelines, so that I can automate metadata generation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support non-interactive batch mode operation
2. WHEN integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate exit codes for pipeline handling
3. WHEN generating in pipelines THEN the system SHALL support environment variable configuration
4. WHEN output is needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats including JSON and YAML

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an AI engineer, I want to integrate with RAG systems for enhanced metadata generation, so that I can leverage large language models for intelligent software analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RAG integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
2. WHEN generating metadata THEN the system SHALL use RAG to enhance descriptions, categorization, and missing field completion
3. WHEN LLM services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to traditional metadata sources
4. WHEN using RAG THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for AI-generated content

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to export training data for model fine-tuning, so that I can improve software metadata generation models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting training data THEN the system SHALL generate datasets in formats suitable for model training (JSONL, CSV, Parquet)
2. WHEN preparing training data THEN the system SHALL include input-output pairs for supervised learning
3. WHEN creating datasets THEN the system SHALL support data augmentation and synthetic example generation
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include metadata quality labels and confidence scores for training

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to collect and analyze software metadata patterns, so that I can build better models for automated software understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL gather comprehensive software metadata from all supported repositories
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL identify common software categories, naming conventions, and dependency patterns
3. WHEN building datasets THEN the system SHALL support stratified sampling and balanced dataset creation
4. WHEN exporting analytics THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries and pattern analysis reports

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to fine-tune models on software metadata, so that I can create specialized models for software package understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fine-tuning THEN the system SHALL support integration with popular ML frameworks (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL provide pre-processing pipelines for software metadata
3. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL include metrics for metadata accuracy and completeness
4. WHEN deploying models THEN the system SHALL support model serving and inference integration
